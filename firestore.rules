/**
 * @fileOverview Security rules for the Formula Skills Garage application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model, primarily based on `teacherId` for teachers' resources and `studentId` for student-specific data.
 * Teachers can only manage data related to their students and training programs. Students can only access their own progress data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore data is organized hierarchically, with teachers owning students, training programs, and simulations.
 * Student progress is stored under each student's document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Teachers can only manage students, training programs, and simulations that they own.
 * - Students can only access their own progress data.
 * - Data consistency is enforced between the path and the document's internal fields (e.g., teacherId in the path must match teacherId in the document).
 * - Listing operations are generally allowed for owners of subcollections (e.g., a teacher can list their students).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `teacherId` is denormalized into the `Student` and `TrainingProgram` documents to avoid costly `get()` calls when checking ownership.
