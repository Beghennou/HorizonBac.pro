/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage application.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy:
 *   This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where teachers can only
 *   manage data related to their students and training programs. Students can
 *   only access their own progress data.
 *
 * @dataStructure:
 *   Data is nested under `/teachers/{teacherId}` and `/students/{studentId}`
 *   collections to establish clear ownership.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions:
 *   - Teachers can only manage students and training programs associated with
 *     their `teacherId`.
 *   - Students can only access their own `studentProgress` data.
 *   - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 *   - The `config` collection is not secured in this ruleset. If sensitive
 *     configuration data is stored here in a production environment, it will
 *     need to be secured with appropriate authorization checks.
 *
 * @denormalizationForAuthorization:
 *   The `teacherId` field is denormalized into the `Student` and
 *   `TrainingProgram` collections to enable fast ownership checks without
 *   requiring additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * @structuralSegregation:
 *   No explicit segregation of public vs. private collections has been specified.
 *   All data is considered private and requires authentication.
