/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that teachers can only access and modify data related to their students and training programs. Students can only access their own progress data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Stores teacher profiles, with teacherId matching the Firebase auth.uid.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with explicit teacherId fields.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Stores training programs created by teachers, with explicit teacherId fields.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Stores simulation data associated with training programs, with an explicit trainingProgramId.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Stores student progress data, with explicit studentId, trainingProgramId, and simulationId fields.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Teachers can only manage students, training programs, and simulations that they own (teacherId in the path matches their auth.uid).
 * - Students can only access their own student progress records.
 * - List operations are generally restricted to the owner (teacher or student) of the data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `teacherId` is denormalized into the `Student` and `TrainingProgram` documents to allow direct ownership checks without additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Student progress data is stored under the /students/{studentId} path to ensure that only the student can access it.
