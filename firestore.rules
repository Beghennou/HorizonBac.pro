/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model, primarily based on the authenticated user's ID (auth.uid).
 * Teachers can manage their own profiles, students, training programs, and simulations.
 * Students can manage their own progress records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Stores teacher profiles, where teacherId matches the Firebase auth.uid.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, with explicit teacherId fields for authorization.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Stores training programs created by teachers, with explicit teacherId fields.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Stores simulation data associated with training programs, with an explicit trainingProgramId.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Stores student progress data, with explicit studentId, trainingProgramId, and simulationId fields.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed unless explicitly required and secured (e.g., a teacher listing their own students).
 * - Data consistency between paths and document fields is enforced on create and update operations to prevent privilege escalation.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'teacherId' is denormalized into the Student and TrainingProgram collections to avoid costly `get()` calls and enforce teacher ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Data is segregated into teacher-owned and student-owned subcollections to maintain clear authorization boundaries.
