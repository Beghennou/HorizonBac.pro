/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model, primarily based on the authenticated user's ID (auth.uid).
 * Teachers can only manage their own students, training programs, and associated simulations.
 * Students can only access their own progress data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher profiles, where teacherId matches the Firebase auth.uid.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Student profiles managed by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Training programs created by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Simulations associated with a training program.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Student progress data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Teachers can only manage data directly under their teacher ID.
 * - Students can only manage data directly under their student ID.
 * - Listing operations are generally allowed within a user's scope.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `teacherId` is denormalized into the `Student` and `TrainingProgram` documents.
 *   This allows rules to directly check ownership without additional `get()` calls.
