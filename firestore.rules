/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model, primarily based on the authenticated user's ID (auth.uid).
 * Teachers can manage their own data (students, training programs, simulations), and students can only
 * access their own progress data.  Read access is generally restricted to the owner, with listing
 * permissions granted to owners for their subcollections.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Stores teacher profiles, with teacherId matching the Firebase auth.uid.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles under a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Stores training programs created by teachers.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Stores simulation data associated with training programs.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Stores student progress data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is generally disallowed to prevent enumeration attacks.
 * - TeacherId is denormalized into Student and TrainingProgram collections to simplify authorization.
 * - All write operations require authentication (isSignedIn()).
