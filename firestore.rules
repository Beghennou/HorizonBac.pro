/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Teachers can only manage data related to their students and training programs.
 * Students can only manage their own progress data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database is structured hierarchically:
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Teacher profiles, where teacherId is the Firebase auth.uid.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Student profiles managed by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Training programs created by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Simulations within a training program.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Student progress records.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Teachers have full CRUD access to students, training programs, and simulations under their ownership.
 * - Students have full CRUD access to their own progress records.
 * - User listing is generally disallowed for privacy and performance reasons.
 * - Authorization is based on matching the authenticated user's UID to the document's owner ID (teacherId or studentId).
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'Student' and 'TrainingProgram' entities denormalize the 'teacherId' to enable authorization rules that don't require extra reads.
