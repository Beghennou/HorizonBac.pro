/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules for Formula Skills Garage.
 *
 * @corePhilosophy
 * This ruleset enforces a strict ownership model where teachers can only access and modify data related to their own students and training programs.
 * Students can only access their own progress data.  All data is nested under teacher or student IDs to enforce clear ownership.
 *
 * @dataStructure
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}: Stores teacher profiles.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles managed by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}: Stores training programs created by a teacher.
 * - /teachers/{teacherId}/trainingPrograms/{trainingProgramId}/simulations/{simulationId}: Stores simulation data for a training program.
 * - /students/{studentId}/studentProgress/{studentProgressId}: Stores student progress records.
 *
 * @keySecurityDecisions
 * - Teachers can only create, update, or delete students, training programs, and simulations that they own (i.e., where the teacherId matches their auth.uid).
 * - Students can only create, update, or delete their own progress data (i.e., where the studentId matches their auth.uid).
 * - Listing of students and training programs is allowed for the owning teacher.
 * - Listing of progress data is allowed for the owning student.
 * - No public data access is allowed (get, list only allowed with proper auth).
